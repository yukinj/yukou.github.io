BFS solution
```python
"""
main idea: transform a/b=k1, b/c=k2 to a ===(cost:k1 )==> b ==(cost:k2)=> c   for query a/c question, convert it into find the shortest cost from a to c. The cost is k1 * k2
step1: build a two dimensional graph in the form of adjacency list.Dividend is key , divisor and cost are  stored in the form of pairs. In a way divisor acts as dividend's neighber.  
step2: start from dividend with cost of 1.0, traverse all the neighbours of dividend. 
step3: pop out first stop from queue, compare if cur_divisor is same of target_divisor from query.
if target_divisor is same as cur_divisor, means the traversal starting from target_dividend has found divisor;
if not found, push current new divisor and cost so far into queue.
step4: Each time a divisor is visited, save it in the set to prevent repeated multiplication.
step5: visited all the neighbours of possible divisor on the way of traversal, updating queue  until queue is empty. it means target divisor is not found. return -1.0
